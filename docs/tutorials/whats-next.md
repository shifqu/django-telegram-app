# 📚 What to read next

After completing the [introductory material](index.md)
, you now have a fully functioning and tested Telegram bot.
Great work — that’s the hardest part!

Now it’s time to explore the deeper concepts behind django-telegram-app and understand how the pieces fit together.

The following sections are [topic guides](../topics/index.md), where we explain design choices, architectural patterns, and the rationale behind the framework.

If you're looking for a more technical, API-focused overview, the [API Reference](../reference/index.md)
 provides detailed information about the core classes, functions, and internal behavior of the library.

Enjoy building Django-powered Telegram bots — and may your commands always execute cleanly! ✌️
